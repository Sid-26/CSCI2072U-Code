This is a demonstration of some of the Latex commands that you need for the assignment.
\[
f(x)= x^{\frac{1}{2} } \frac{\sin x}{\log x} \]
To write math        expression in line, you have to put a \$ at each
side of the expression.  So if we want the write the function in-line, we need to put f(x).
